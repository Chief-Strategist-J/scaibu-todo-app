# main command =>  flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

#  Commands
# 1. build: Runs a single build and exits.
# 2. watch: Runs a persistent build server that watches the files system for edits and does rebuilds as necessary.
# 3. serve: Same as watch, but runs a development server as well.
# 4. test: Runs a single build, creates a merged output directory, and then runs dart run test --precompiled <merged-output-dir>. See below for instructions on passing custom args to the test command.

#  Command Line Options
# All the above commands support the following arguments:
# 1. --help: Print usage information for the command.
# 2. --delete-conflicting-outputs: Assume conflicting outputs in the users package are from previous builds, and skip the user prompt that would usually be provided.
# 3. --[no-]fail-on-severe: Whether to consider the build a failure on an error logged. By default this is false.
# 4. --build-filter: Build filters allow you to choose explicitly which files to build instead of building entire directories. See further documentation on this feature here.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/translations/
    - assets/image/
    - assets/icon/
    - assets/json/loginPageAssets/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
